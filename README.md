# üîç Melanoma Detection Project
**A clear disclaimer:** This tool is not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis, but a first step in awareness.
The purpose of this tool is to encourage users to take charge of their own health by checking potential signs of melanoma early.
In relation to diseases like cancer, the importance of early detection is crucial.

This project was built as part of CareTech to teach students how to build a machine learning model from scratch and deploy it in a full-stack web application. 
Users will be able to upload a picture of a mole into our web application and have our 
machine learning model predict the chance of the mole being melanoma.

## How does it work?
1. Visit the homepage of our web application.
2. Click on the **‚ÄúScan Me‚Äù** button or the **Scan** tab in the navbar.
3. Upload an image of a skin lesion or mole.
4. Press Submit.
5. Our custom trained machine learning model will process the image and display the prediction on a results page.
